| prints all numbers from 1 to 10
|

| the following code line is the same as:
| i: int 0 > [cond, incr]
| (due to inode default value)

i: int > [cond, incr]  | send i to 2 consumers
10: int > cond

loop: {root} branch
cond: ==
end

println >> loop
incr: +
1

| it is wrong!
| doesn't mutate i while looping!
